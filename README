q1: Find the source
In a field, we have hidden an object with a radio transmitter. However, a battery
failure has made it so that the transmitter emits pulses only once every 6 hours. You
have already taken measurements at two points and, from the strength of the signal,
determined the distance that the object must be from those points. Your job now is
to write a program to find all of the locations, if any, where the object might be. You
only have the two datapoints you have already taken, and you canâ€™t wait to take any
more.

Your program will be given an input file that contains two data points that look like
the following, each on a separate line.

<x position> <y position> <distance from object>

For example, consider the following input:

***
6.0 8.0 5.0
0.0 0.0 5.0
***

Then the output of your program should be:

***
3.0 4.0
***

which indicates that the object must reside at coordinates x = 3, y = 4.

q2: Justify text

Suppose you are programming for a really old-school internet newspaper, one that is
so old-school that they only have monospace fonts. However, the editor really wants
to see the monospace text justified to fit into the column space he has at a particular
time. Your job is to write a program that will take as input the width of the column in
characters and the entire text to be formatted, and return the same text except justified
to fit into the column.

For example, consider the following input:

***
20
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
***

Then the output of your program should be:

***
The quick brown fox
jumps over the lazy
dog.
***

As you can tell from this example, the last line does not have to be justified.

q5: Spiral print

Write a function to print a 2-D array (n x m) in spiral order (clockwise).

For example, consider the following input:

***
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
***

Then the output of your program should be:

***
1 2 3 6 9 8 7 4 5
***
